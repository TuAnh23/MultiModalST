Speech Translation (ST) is the task of translating speech audio in a source language into text in a target language. This repository implements and does experiments on 3 different approaches for ST:
- Cascaded ST, including 2 steps: Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation
- End-to-end ST with end-to-end data
- End-to-end ST with no end-to-end data using Zero-shot learning

The Transformer architecture is used as the baseline for the implementation.
